/**
 * Features that are built and merged but not yet released.
 *
 * The same bundle ships everywhere and `public/config.js` differs per
 * deployment, so a feature can be live in stage and hidden in prod without
 * branching the build or holding work out of `main`.
 *
 * ```js
 * ONE_WSO2_PREVIEW_FEATURES: { umt: true },
 * ```
 *
 * ## Absent means off
 *
 * A feature nobody has listed is hidden. Prod is safe because nobody touched
 * its config, not because someone remembered to write `false` — the failure
 * mode of the opposite default is a half-finished screen appearing in
 * production on the day it merges.
 *
 * ## This is not the `is*Configured()` contract
 *
 * `apiConfig.ts` hides things when a backend URL is empty, which means *"not
 * wired up"*. This means *"wired up, but not for you yet"*. The two look alike
 * and answer different questions: if a preview feature's backend is also
 * missing, both apply and either one hiding it is correct.
 *
 * ## Delete the gate when the feature ships
 *
 * Every entry names the release it is waiting on. A set that only grows stops
 * describing anything — it becomes the list of things nobody cleaned up, and
 * then no one can say what production actually has. Removing a flag is part of
 * shipping the feature, not a follow-up.
